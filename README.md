# Physica

## About

Physica is an all-purpose experimental physics package for python. It aims to solve a lot of the common problems students encounter, and to enable easy data analysis.

## History

My undergraduate study took place at [the University of Auckland](http://auckland.ac.nz) in New Zealand. As part of the physics curriculum there, students are required to complete Physics 390, a third-stage Experimental Physics paper. Some of the labs required the use of a file called phylab.py, which was riddled with errors (both logical and semantic), and had been rather poorly converted from MATLAB, to Python 2, to Python 3. During my completion of those labs, I slowly added to the file, making corrections, until I had a working version. This package is a collection of functions I both developed and fixed. Whether you too are doing 390, or are using this for another purpose, I hope you find it useful.
